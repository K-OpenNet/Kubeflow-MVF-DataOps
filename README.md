# Kubeflow-MVF-DataOps

Data scientists use tools like Kubeflow and Airflow to automate machine learning workflows, but data engineers need their own DataOps tools for pipeline management.

As the data and analytics pipelines become more complex and the development team grows in size, standard processes must be applied to manage data flows from one stage of the data lifecycle to the next in the data collection and management process. The goal is to increase agility and cycle time while reducing data flaws, giving developers and business users confidence in the data analysis output.

The emerging DataOps field borrows many concepts from DevOps technology used in general software engineering with a focus on agility, leanness, and continuous delivery. The main difference is that it is implemented in a data analysis environment that covers many data sources, data warehouses, and analytic methods.

Our purpose of this is to implement DataOps for one data pipeline for ML workflow applied to Multi-View Framework (MVF).
This is a very fragmentary example and I will use it as a UseCase in DataOps.
