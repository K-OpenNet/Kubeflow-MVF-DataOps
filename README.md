# Kubeflow-MVF-DataOps

The emerging DataOps field borrows many concepts from DevOps technology used in general software engineering with a focus on agility, leanness, and continuous delivery. The main difference is that it is implemented in a data analysis environment that covers many data sources, data warehouses, and analytic methods.
The purpose of this is to implement DataOps for one data pipeline for ML workflow applied to Multi-View Framework (MVF).
