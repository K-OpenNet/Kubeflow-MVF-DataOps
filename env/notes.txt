<Notes>
1. Graphics card and corresponding driver should be installed.
2. We considered NVIDIA graphics cards.
3. This script enables multi-GPU on a single node, not on multiple nodes.
4. Since ceph storage uses the infrastructure of our laboratory, the storageclass configuration is different from the usual case.

<Precautions>
If you want to rebuild Kubernetes on the cluster you configured once, you will need to modify the existing configuration.
